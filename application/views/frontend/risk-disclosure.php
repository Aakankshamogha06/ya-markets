                    <p>The effect of leverage allows you to trade larger amounts of money than deposit. However, leverage can either work on your side or against you. At the same time, psychological factor plays an important role. Some traders choose a big size of leverage to operate bigger sums. It creates the illusion of "unlimited profit opportunities without any risk", but actually, it is not always like that. A big volume of traded funds may bring great profit because of the leverage, but never forget that, along with the income, there is a big possibility to lose almost all deposit. Carefully analyze and choose the size of the leverage that will help you avoid a high level of risk.</p>
